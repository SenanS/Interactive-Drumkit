# Interactive-Drumkit

I created a projected image of a drum kit on my wall.<br/>
It's interactable using copper tape capacitive touch sensors, taped to the wall and read by an Arduino Uno. <br/>
The Arduino communicates with a Processing sketch, which plays the sounds and animates the projected image.<br/>
